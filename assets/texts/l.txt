Lifelong Learning
One of the most important pedagogical and didactical characteristics of No School is that learning is understood as a non-schoolish and rather natural process that can be described as lifelong learning. Learning is not limited to a certain period in life, or only relatable to a school environment, but it rather is an essential part of our biography.
We learn in contact with the world: the world we perceive as children, as adolescents, as adults, and even as older human beings. Life is learning. This means that we are scholars as long as we live. In this process of learning, the No School student does not associate learning with a teacher-centred model, but instead with a student-centred one.
Essential to this new way of conceiving the teacher-student relationship is the path of the free and creative scholar who, like an artist, wanders through life, meets interesting people, discovers new ideas and tries to learn from them. Sometimes this means resting for a while in a place of inspiration â€”a creative space that can be a school, an office, or a studio, or a hub where creative production is stimulated. In doing so, with the help of others, in a local and global network system of relationships, the creative skills are mastered and the creative individuality can evolve.
In this original academic model, there is a central space for self-learning, self-assessment and self-teaching. Does this mean that there is no teacher anymore? No. Although the title of teacher slowly disappears, moving away from that formal function that was once defined by some lines on a diploma.
It becomes, as it was originally meant to be, an award, an honourable distinction, a temporary title for a person who is a true master in his/her preferred subject, and far and foremost an inspiring person who is able to energize and empower others.
