ZigZag
Even when you discover something brilliant by accident, you are still brilliant because you have brought yourself in the position to encounter this brilliant thing.
-Frans Oort
The highest reward for a person's toil is not what they get for it, but what they become by it.
-John Ruskin
No School provides space to follow your own ambitions, ideas and questions and transform them into actions. This means going off the beaten track, and the path you take will by definition not be straight, but will zigzag in a wonderful and stimulating way.
Permanent learning, and realizing dreams and ambitions, have no fixed formats. Your own path will develop as you go along, while making use of logical thinking, intuition, and chance.
A zigzag line is a movement or line that can be suddenly subjected to one or more serious changes in course. Your goal, a visualised 'dot on the horizon' is what sets you in motion.
You have thought hard about the steps you wish to take and you are capable of changing course, of improvising whenever unique opportunities present themselves or unexpected challenges cross your path. Along the way you keep asking questions and you take the time to find the answers yourself.
Courage and hope create room for wandering, creativity, and critical thinking; for doubt, for making mistakes, and for recognizing unexpected chances and taking them.
In my opinion, zigzagging is the art of learning and of life. Passion for your own idea and authentic view help you to learn how to feel comfortable about change, uncertainty, complexity, and duality, and to see them as opportunities for personal and professional growth.
No School is an adventure that requires an effort and carries risks, while at the same time providing heaps of inspiration, energy, and meaning. Choose your own adventure, dare to zigzag, stay curious, persevere, and you will discover the art of a beautiful life and No School.
