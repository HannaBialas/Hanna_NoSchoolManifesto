Industry
It's the start-ups, the creative breeding grounds, the big ideas of little entrepreneurs that make the world go round. It's the young people inspiring the elderly, and vice versa. It's the entrepreneurs who not only think creatively, but also act creatively. Therefore, learning is not something one does in an isolated environment called school, but right in the middle of society. Inspiring collaborations can lead students to take their own special path.
Sharon van de Most: 'It all began at my grandfather's birthday. The women there were discussing orthopaedic shoes, and how they lacked elegance. I thought: I'm going to produce those elegant shoes. During my first work experience I mainly did production. I learned how to stitch and gained insight into patterns: the fact that one little line determines what the finished shoe will look like. After that I learned about quality at René van den Berg's custom shoes workshop.
I now know how to make a good quality shoe. Also, I learned to reflect more on my future. René told me about his steps and missteps, about his knowledge and about making choices in quality?
René van den Berg: 'Sharon is motivated, talented, and has the drive to become an orthopaedic shoemaker. In my workshop she learned to embrace new techniques and methods. What I have learned from Sharon is curiosity and freedom. For example, she would ask: "I think this could be done differently. Can we try it?"*
No School involves the industry, society. So that you can learn what you want to learn, with whom you want to learn, and where you want to learn. Because we think that it can be done differently!
