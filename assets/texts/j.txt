Jam 
There's no problem that I can't fix 'cause I can do it in the mix
A group of musicians on stage, busily moving to the beat, which is exactly right. The sounds and the rhythm woven into one sound, a challenging base simply begging for a solo.
An unexpected melodic line follows and then suddenly there is this perfectly timed break. It's magical, euphoric, as if time no longer exists.
Do you know this feeling? Either as a musician or as a member of the audience? The right mix that brings joy, arrived at in a jam with others, bigger than yourself. Social issues require the right mix of knowledge, skills, and creative connectors, something a solo act cannot accomplish. This is how creatives discover themselves, connect with each other and their environment, and learn where and when they can add value. In an environment in which change is the only constant, the ideal mix is dynamic and can only originate when you are able to reinvent yourself again and again.
Learning is a hybrid process that requires constant flexibility and improvisation. This is why No School gives creativity free rein, based on freedom, trust, and equality.
When you want to learn how to jam, you not only practice regularly but also together shape the stage on which you play. Along the way you learn about yourself, about each other, and your environment. This creates new connections and opportunities. Everything is a remix.
It takes multidisciplinary encounters to engage in real connections. For example, No School remixes art, science, research, philosophy, and design. This stimulates curiosity and invites dialogue and exploring creativity within new contexts.
Intrinsic motivation is a good start to stimulate a state of flow.
Creativity challenges us in a process of discovery: not the result is what is most important, but exploring possibilities with dedication and attention. The reward is an experience of joy.
