Gap 
There is a gap between dream and reality. Why is this so?
And will we ever be able to bridge the gap? Dreaming of and working towards a different and better world is typically human. We have the mental capacity to imagine what is not actually there. We also have the capability to bring into reality something which was not yet there.
Imagining and creating a better world plays an important part in thinking about the impact on ethics of technology. In modern Western society we adhered to a mainly utopian vision.
If you are a utopian, you believe in progress. You believe that technology improves life in all aspects: living longer without illness, flying to exotic places, and all the food you want is available in the supermarket all year round. Twentieth-century philosophers have warned us about the other, dystopian side of technology. For instance, the dream of cheap and abundant energy from atoms has also led to the threat of nuclear war, and nuclear waste has contributed to the environmental crisis.
And, more recently, there is the debate about the question whether Artificial Intelligence really is an improvement or that it will lead to us humans being dominated by technology.
Between the utopian dream and the dystopian nightmare there's also a gap. There's no point in being paralyzed by apocalyptic images, nor can we afford to keep on dreaming innocently. We have to bring our creativity to a higher level to go beyond this. We can practice our imagination and our thinking by building dream scenarios as well as doom scenarios. By taking dangers more into account, designs can actually improve. And then we can look for designs with a positive impact on our future in a creative and ethically responsible way.
