Wandering
Einstein famously said: If you keep doing what you're doing now, you're never going to have anything different than what you've already got.' So, just start experimenting and trying things out.
After all, many inventions are not the result of good research, but of research with an unexpected result. Take penicillin. Its discoverer, Alexander Fleming, while cleaning up his lab after a two-week absence, happened to notice that in some petri dishes a mould had grown. Not planned, but discovered all the same.
The trick is to get this process started among students as best we can, without inhibitions. No School states, somewhat proudly, that it's okay to make mistakes. But, what's in a name....
This motto may sound a bit flippant but if you think about it, there's more to it. In our society a mistake is a mistake.
The good-natured No School advice that mistakes are okay, still assumes that mistakes can be made. However, mistakes are not cool. Just look at synonyms such as fault, error, deviation, imperfection, and, perhaps the worst one: blunder.
But I think there is no such thing as a mistake in the creative process. It is not a linear process, let alone that learning it is a straightforward afair. You can't make wrong choices during these 'wandering processes' and therefore you can't get wrong results either. There is no fixed goal, the process serves the intention.
This is why we must look for a new word to describe the results of creative processes, without labelling them as either right' or wrong. I propose 'Unexpected Result. It describes very well what the outcome of the creative process is, without passing judgment. Discovering things is what gives you the input to go on. The Unexpected Result contains surprise, innovation, and imagination: the provisional outcome of wandering.
