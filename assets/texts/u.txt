Universe
A Big Bang of Creativity. There is much going on, the world is at a critical point. A shift is taking place in space; it is grand, unknown, and exciting. A megastar is about to explode, and change its form. A new moon has been discovered. The ultimate climax is the discovery of an immense explosion:
'Astronomers have discovered the biggest explosion in the universe since the Big Bang: an explosion by which all others pale' (NOS Journaal, 2020). This explosion is called the Universe of Creativity and consists of space and time. Space and time to wonder, to explore, to discover, to experiment, to dare, to wish, to dream, to look around, to wander, to long.
To connect.
The universe is all about the energy between the planets, moons, stars, and the voyagers. The universe connects the self with the other, links possible solutions to many problems and connects the world with itself. The universe fills itself with inspiration, curiosity, openness, and imagination, full of innovative and new possibilities. These new connections arise with and from passion, joy, and growth.
Creativity is the oxygen in a universe full of possible routes and freedom of choice. In the universe there's a mothership that is always in touch with the voyagers, which makes them feel safe to challenge themselves and make new discoveries with Creative Confidence as their fellow voyager.
Authenticity and wilfulness come first. Let yourself be transported in space and time, travel freely, without beginning, without end, and full of confidence. Feel free to become a traveller of the creative universe!
