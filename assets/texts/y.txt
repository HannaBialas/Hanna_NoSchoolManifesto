YES!
Saying no to something is, at a deeper level, saying yes to something else. So, no is not the opposite of yes, but stems from it
-Berthold Gunster
No School says "No' to the schoolish system that hasn't essentially changed since the Industrial Revolution. At the same time, No School says a clear 'Yes': yes to learning with guts, yes to experimenting, yes to fun!
This is a yes with an exclamation mark! If we would app it, we'd write "Yesssss!!! And add a few smileys for good measure. A Yes with just one 's' doesn't really count as a real yes these days. That is a 'yes, but...' or 'saying yes and doing the opposite. That's an okay, a yep, an alright.
So, we wholeheartedly say Yesss! And with this manifesto we wish to underline the necessity of thinking differently about learning. It is up to us to break through the thinking in systems. It is up to us to find a form for this Yes, to design the learning of creative people in a way that fits with the now and with the future.
We have already started and we keep on going. We experiment a lot and present ourselves in the Netherlands and abroad with our central theme: The learning of creative people?
The underlying question is: how can we learn without being frustrated by barriers between levels or by legal frameworks that define the context of where and how learning should take place?
And now it is also up to you to say yes! To join us. To strengthen the movement. So, join us and say Yes to 'learning is LEF*.
"LEF. in Dutch, "lef" means 'guts', " bravery. It also stands for Learning Experiment Fun.
