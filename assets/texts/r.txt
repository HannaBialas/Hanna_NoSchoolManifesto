Roots
In nature, a tree with weak roots will collapse. Do we need to understand where we come from, do we need to know our roots?
'Who am I?' is the most difficult question we ask ourselves.
It depends on the context of where we are. On social media platforms: how do you want to present yourself? Every platform has its own context and each different presentation of your identity is like another head. Identity is what helps us identify ourselves with the various social groups we interact with, giving us a sense of belonging. Knowing who we are, where we come from, having a strong sense of identity can help us to be more socially adaptable and can be a rich source of material for our creative activities. A lack of identity can create a conflict that can be of great detriment to our mental and physical health and maybe even make us prone to criminal behaviour.
When the root is deep, there is no reason to fear the wind
â€”African proverb
A rhizome, sometimes called a creeping rootstalk, is a stem of a plant that sends out roots and shoots as it spreads. Nomads have the ability to learn rhizomatically, to 'self-reproduce', to grow and change ideas as they explore new contexts. They are not looking for 'the accepted way, they are creating new paths.
A rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo. The planar movement of the rhizome resists chronology and organization, instead favouring a nomadic system of growth and propagation.
Matt Burr and Tim Sarchet, co-founders of Nomadic
Learning created an online learning platform that brings peopletogether. They asked themselves: how to make 'memory-pathways' that stick in our mind? How to bring learning to life?
