Fun
Why the long face?'
Yes, this is a serious article on a serious subject, but let's not forget the humorous side! After all, humour and fun combine very well with creative education. Humour and creativity share multiple characteristics anyway, such as playfulness, taking risks, and free association. Research has shown that humour and creativity have a positive correlation.
As Ed van Leeuwen so nicely puts it: 'Creativity is thinking in a curve. It is the art of breaking with patterns, habits, and certainties, which is no easy task for the human brain.
Breaking patterns can happen incidentally, through lateral thinking, or through humour. The mechanisms behind humour and lateral thinking are the same.
Each time we make a new neurological connection, we are maintaining our ability to continue to make other connections. Creative thinking exists in the realm of previously unconnected thoughts. Similarly, making connections between unconnected items is a big part of what makes humor work.
A joke is often funny because of an unexpected turn in the storyline that takes the listener away from the obvious line of thinking: a fixed pattern is broken.
Of course, one doesn't have to appear before a group as a stand-up comedian in order to introduce fun into education. Fun can also be created by adapting the learning environment. Humour has the potential to create a reassuring atmosphere. It makes people feel comfortable because they are allowed to show their playful side in an environment where this is often not tolerated.
So why not start a learning process with a joke for a change, in order to 'loosen up' your audience; it's not all that hard, really...
