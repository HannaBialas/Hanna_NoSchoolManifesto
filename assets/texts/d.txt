Dare
Daring is to be adventurous. The days when one learned a profession and then practised it for forty years have long since gone.
 The future is constantly changing because of technological and societal developments. The question is: what does vocational 
 training actually train for if the professions of today will no longer exist in a few years' time? 
 No School doesn't wait and even dares to start.
Daring is taking a stance. No School dares to put its money on creativity as the most important skill of the future. 
Creativity-also in the opinion of the World Economic Forum-is the engine for innovation and ideation'.
 The typical creative is a T-shaped professional (both generalist and specialist) who is able to make connections and create 
 crossovers. Philosopher Martha Nussbaum
also thinks that it's obvious to pay attention to 'soft skills.
She advocates using 'liberal arts', as these trigger narrative imagination.
 Or 'the ability to think what it is like to be in someone else's shoes; to understand their emotions, wishes, and longings.
Daring is letting go. Dare we break up the diploma mindset? No School chooses the portfolio, because you are what you do.
 The portfolio is already a well-known format in the creative industry but is now becoming important for everyone.
The portfolio visualizes a person's learning, and that is unique.
Daring is having the courage to do. No School connects demand and supply. Learning is a fluid process that widens, concentrates,
 slows down or speeds up with fits and starts.
It provides those who are learning with the opportunity to learn the things they need at the moment when they need them.
Because learning does not just take place in school from 8 to 5, but happens always and everywhere. Not just during your school days',
 but your whole life.
