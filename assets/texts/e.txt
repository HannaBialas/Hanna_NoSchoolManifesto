Expedition
In Odyssey Homer tells us that life is about finding your Ithaca. In other words, In other words: everyone will find their destination
 in the end. But we can all agree that lifelong learning isn't about finding a destination, it's about the journey itself. 
 Life unfolds itself in mysterious ways and every moment is meant to be discovered.
We are on an expedition without a map and with the sole purpose of wonder. Wondering is wanting to find answers even if the questions
 aren't asked. Therefore, exploring starts with curiosity. We can learn so much from our environment when we take the time to observe 
 closely and listen deeply.
When we try to look at the same things with different eyes and connect them with our surroundings, we will see more. 
Also, when you want to learn more about creativity, humanity and yourself: simply go outside!
To the eyes of the man of imagination, nature is imagination itself.
-William Blake
No School encourages students to choose their own learning journey. Students are teachers, and teachers are students.
Together we are learners with an insatiable hunger to explore a world of ideas. And we want to add even more ideas of our own.
 During this travel, we discover, we learn more and more about our destination. Because, as Confucius said: 'When you go outside,
  you go inside.'
