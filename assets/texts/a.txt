Alpha
You cannot imagine life without internet and you spend about eight hours a day at a screen. 
There is no longer a distinction between online and off-line; social media are intensely interwoven with your life. 
Some of your friends you've never met in real life, even though you 'see' them via internet on a daily basis. 
You may already have your own YouTube channel by which you earn money.
 You don't see anything strange in asking questions and getting answers from computers and you assume that
  you can actually have a conversation with a machine. Were you born after 2010? Then you are part of this generation: Alpha.
Alphas are 'screenagers' with different learning habits.
Facts, dates, figures, and places are no longer memorized but searched', as are the answers to simple questions.
 Alphas have more faith in Artificial Intelligence than in human mind power.
As a result, their capability to store information in their own brains and later retrieve it has diminished, 
whereas their skills in finding information online are quite excellent. Information is quickly found and properly filtered. 
There is even selective blindness involved.
Generation Alpha is curious: they are always looking for something that is even more interesting,
 which means that an attention span of eight seconds is the norm. Alphas are enterprising, well-educated,
  and self-sufficient; they accept bigger challenges and are competitive in attitude.
This generation has high demands, and therefore I would advise No School to follow the example of online services:
 always there, always available, immediate feedback, tailored to the individual, and all that at the push of a button.
