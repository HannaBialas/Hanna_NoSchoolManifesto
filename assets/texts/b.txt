Blank Space
We've been drawing a map, including questions, prompts, and blank spaces to write and sketch. 
To enter this blank space on the map, is to enter the zone of possibilities and hope.
In No School Manifesto blank space is an invitation to think, an encouragement to provide additions and pose new questions.
How do we generate meaning together? How can creativity improve the world?
In a similar quest for answers to such questions, Lucas De Man claims: 'I don't know, but neither do you. 
Only when you admit that you don't know, you can meet yourself, someone else, or the world.' 
This raises the question of whether we dare to embrace this not-knowing in all its vulnerability?
No School does: we don't know, but others don't know either. We do, however, search for possible answers.
Starting from not-knowing we explore the space, the boundaries, and the unbounded. This is how we explore borderless learning. 
Where can we find common ground? Can we arrive at a 'shared problem space' with a focus on issues that concern us all?
One of the ways to engage in this exploration together is by applying the Open Space Method.
Open Space is a simple, powerful, and dynamic work form that provides space for debate and collaboration.
Applying the Open Space principle greatly enhances involvement, ownership, and effectiveness,
as the input comes from the participants themselves. They are running the show.
What would it be like if we could apply this formula of openness to creative learning trajectories? 
What Images arise when we transform our blank space by changing our perspective?
