Oxygen
All the cells in our body need oxygen to produce energy, to recover, to stay alive. Oxygen provides the connection, provides life. We do all sorts of things to absorb enough oxygen. We go outside to get some fresh air. We catch our breath during yoga.
We move, so that our heart can pump the oxygen through our body. But are we providing enough oxygen to our learning, to growing and developing?
We mostly live indoors and formal learning usually takes place between four walls. The environment is defined, learning is set down in curriculums, safeguarded in requirements and conditions. The result is an educational system that is more like a historical coincidence than a scientifically underpinned model. In this system oxygen is a scarcity. Panting and puffing we chase after our rapidly changing environment.
Let's give learning some breathing space!
Play, pause, movement, and fresh air
With our focus on 'intelligence', learning has become something we do with our heads. But learning is done with our entire body. Moving, pausing, letting your thoughts wander: it all stimulates the brain. In the 'default network mode' brains are given the opportunity to reorganize.
Go out
Learning benefits from 'pottering. Pick up bits and pieces here and there, taste something different, find your way while tinkering, meet other beings to do something with. Outside the gate you make an appeal to a more broadly defined intelligence; one in which creativity and doing are important.
