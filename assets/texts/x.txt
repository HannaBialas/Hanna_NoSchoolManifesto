XL
No School is a platform, is a new model and is first and foremost an expanding Movement. Connecting people, exchanging ideas, blending passions. Now is the time to enlarge our vision onto extra-large possibilities. The No School Movement XL can be understood as a critical social movement: characterized as a diffuse network of people sympathizing with a certain ideal or goal, without being a political party, thus free of limitations, and therefore showing great variations. The No School Movement is a creative movement. It aims at attacking the far-reaching rationalization, formalization, and economization of society, by arguing for the transformation of education, the cultural breeding ground of this dominant story. The main motivation is changing nineteenth-century degenerative forms of schooling into open creative spaces: less reductionist, less bureaucratic, and less profit-driven.
The No School Movement looks like a contemporary imagination of the antique (No) School of Athens or the medieval (No) School of Chartres. It is an open (virtual) network of wandering teachers and learners, a meeting place of fellow thinkers of different origins. Changing relationships without formal restrictions through an open network. A shared (sometimes latent and sometimes manifest) connection based on creative evolution of nature and the human being as part of it.
An intellectual, aesthetic, and practice-based open community in constant dialogue with the whole and its particles, connecting nature-human -and technique as complementary aspects of a creative universe.
