Questioning
When he came home from school, Albert Einstein's mother would often ask him: 'Well, did you ask good questions?' She had a point there, because curiosity starts with wondering about things, with asking questions. And we do this all the time: every second, Google processes about 40,000 searches and of these about fifteen percent are new ones, every day: questions that have never been asked before. Prior to these searches something must have happened: you were triggered by something and now you want to know, experience, or feel something. What question did you ask? What shortage of information presented itself? What were you wondering about?
In his book Doe dit vooral thuis [Do try this at home] the philosopher Bas Haring addresses scientific, philosophical, and useless questions for young people. Questions that may make you think, but especially encourage you to act! With Haring questions lead to action, research, and fun. The question:
'Can you cook a meal in a washing machine?' Is being tested by preparing a dish of sauerkraut and potatoes in little bags, using the washing machine's high-temperature programme.
It doesn't sound very appetizing, but it is certainly instructive!
No School poses questions about learning, about creativity. But more importantly, No School gives participants room to formulate new questions. Because self-obtained knowledge is first-hand knowledge' (Kessels and Gordijn 2005) and that takes better root and gives the best learning outcomes.
So do keep formulating questions yourself. Go on investigating assumptions and questioning prejudice. Or, in the words of Google's CEO Eric Schmidt: We run this company on questions, not answers.' So, give it a try. What question is on your mind right now? What question may cause a tiny whirlwind in your organization, in your life, in your daily routine?
