    <h1>No School Manifesto</h1>
    <p>1. No School envisions a rethinking of education for the twenty-first century.</p>
    <p>2. No School aims to bridge the gap between culture and nature.</p>
    <p>3. No School advocates a shift from what benefits the individual to what benefits the community and the entire planet.</p>
    <p>4. No School defines creative learning as an individual process, akin to the artistic process, rooted in connecting with the inherent creative source in nature.</p>
    <p>5. No School promotes a shift to creativity, recognizing it as the fundamental formative power in all of nature, which humans can tap into.</p>
    <p>6. No School sees students as 'learners' and teachers as 'leading learners', both scholars contributing, at their respective levels, to this creative inquiry.</p>
    <p>7. No School values the use of senses, intellect, and imagination equally for everyone, rejecting systems of punishment and institutions of control.</p>
    <p>8. No School is a radical movement seeking to affirm the necessity of free education by challenging the economic foundations it rests upon.</p>
    <p>9. No School opposes an economic system based solely on transactions between bureaucratic governments and conservative institutions.</p>
    <p>10. No School advocates for an economic system where a network of teachers and students receives direct funding to create innovative forms of education.</p>
    <p>11. No School represents a shift in education, focusing on individuals rather than on a dehumanized, economic-centered system.</p>
